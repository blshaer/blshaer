Hey, I’m **Baraa**, a **Full-Stack Software Engineer**.

I design and build complete applications end to end, shaping user experience, implementing scalable frontend and backend systems, managing data, and owning deployment, with a strong focus on reliability, performance, and maintainability.

I also build **AI-powered applications** as full products, not demos, developing intelligent features that are tightly coupled with real user workflows and business logic.
